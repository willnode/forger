## What

This is an online website builder where it generates an SPA project based on Svelte. No server-side, 100% fully works in browser. 

## Why

Web development should like making a salad. I mean, you only care about making a salad, not growing a tomato from stratch. 

## How

An SPA web project means:
+ Everything, everypage is bundled on a giant JS
+ Separation on pages by URL is handled by routing
+ Able to display a data by AJAX
+ Able to submit a form without leaving the page.

## Inspiration

[Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl) and a friend of mine who frustated creating a website for a client (which should be easy to do for an experienced coder, but not if you're still new in coding and on a tight deadline).
